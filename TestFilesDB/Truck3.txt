The Mercedes-Benz Actros is a heavy-duty truck introduced by Mercedes-Benz in 1995. It is normally used for long-distance haulage, heavy duty distribution haulage and construction haulage. It is available in weights starting at 18 tonnes and is powered by an inline-6 diesel engine with turbocharger and intercooler. Daimler Trucks/Lorries launched the version II of the Actros in 2002, and the version III in 2007. The fourth generation of the Actros, named officially "the New Actros", launched in July 2011.

In July 2011, the manufacturer of Mercedes Benz Trucks, Daimler AG, launched the 2012 Mercedes Benz Actros. This may not be referred to as Actros 4 but it is the New Actros. This is because there were several similarities between Actros 1, 2 and 3. The new Actros has no similarities with its predecessors save for the name.

For the very first time the Actros features a six-cylinder inline engine using Common Rail Diesel Technology with X-Pulse as opposed to the PLD system used previously.

In September 2018, Mercedes Benz revealed the revised 2019 Actros at the IAA Commercial Vehicles Show in Hannover, Germany. The vehicle now has 2 colour displays (touchscreen and infotainment display behind the steering wheel) replacing the conventional instrument cluster on old Actros models and can be integrated with Android Auto or Apple CarPlay. Its outside mirrors were replaced with a camera and it can do semi-automated driving, using Active Drive Assist.
