The MAN TG-range is the range of trucks produced since 2000 by the German vehicle manufacturer MAN Truck & Bus. It is the successor to the original F2000, L2000, and M2000 series. It consisted of the TGA (now discontinued), TGL, TGM, TGS, and TGX.

As of 2016 the TG range is made up of five models, with the introduction of the TGE light commercial vehicle, a rebadged Volkswagen Crafter.

The MAN TGE is a badge engineered version of the second generation Volkswagen Crafter. It is assembled by Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles in Wrzesnia, Poland alongside the Crafter. MAN intends to differentiate itself from Volkswagen by offering a higher standard of service that is aimed at professional customers.
