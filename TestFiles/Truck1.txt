The Volvo FH is a heavy truck range produced by Swedish truck manufacturer Volvo Trucks. Introduced in late 1993 as FH12 and FH16, production still continues with the now the second generation of FH range model lineup. FH stands for Forward control High entry, where numbers denominate engine capacity in litres. The FH range is one of the most successful truck series ever having sold more than 400,000 units worldwide.

In September, 2012, Volvo Trucks re-launched the Volvo FH with significant technology upgrades.
